Linux on Toshiba Portégé Z30-A-12N
==================================

Overview
--------

IMO a very nice, light yet sturdy laptop with comfortable keyboard,
matte display and impressive battery life time.
Completely quiet most of the time, too.
I haven't seen any better for coding while travelling so far
(and that's the reason why I chose it).

With just a few tweaks, runs Linux smoothly. :-)

NOTE: It is very likely that the doc. is valid more generally to
the whole Portégé Z30-A model line.
No guarantees, though.

Installation
------------

Installation of Debian Jessie went just fine.
The machine is equipped with an SSD, so I advice against much
partitioning; I've created just 2 partitions: boot partition
and rootfs partition.
I swap (if ever) to a file;
see link:http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-a-swap-file-howto/[http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-a-swap-file-howto/]
for instance.


Power management
----------------

Suspend works out-of-the-box.
However, making systemd PID 1 helps a bit with GNOME 3 integration,
so you might want that; just add

----
init=/bin/systemd
----

kernel boot-line parameter
to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in `/etc/default/grub` config. file.

Note that I don't use suspend to disk (aka hibernation); the machine can
quite easily live about 9 hours on battery, so suspend to RAM is usually
more than enough.

Display back-light control doesn't work after installation, however,
adding

----
acpi_backlight=vendor
----

kernel boot-line parameter (same place as above) fixes that.

Don't forget to update grub after making your changes:

----
# update-grub
----


ACPI
~~~~

`toshiba_acpi` kernel module is responsible for support for several
platform-specific features.
At time of writing, e.g. keyboard backlight control (via Fn-Z) doesn't
work, but that's true for my current kernel 3.13.
Checking the next stable kernel (3.14.2), it seems that support for
the keyboard backlight was already added.


WiFi & bluetooth
----------------

Install Intel WiFi firmware:

----
# apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi
----

`toshiba_bluetooth` kernel module is auto-loaded, but doesn't seem to be
necessary.
I've found it even counter-productive, since as soon as you disable
bluetooth (e.g. with `rfkill`), it seems to attempt to re-load the Intel
bluetooth firmware every few seconds (at least it certainly pollutes
the kernel ring buffer with messages about it).

Just blacklist the module; create /etc/modprobe.d/toshiba-blacklist.conf
file containing

----
blacklist toshiba_bluetooth
----

and run

----
# depmod -ae
----


Touchpad & trackstick
---------------------

The machine is equipped with an ALPS touchpad and a trackstick.
The input devices work out-of-the-box, but for now only in a kind of
PS/2 mouse compatibility mode, meaning that no multi-touch
is supported.

However, at the time of writing, sub-driver for the`psmouse` kernel
module providing support for the touchpad is in preparation
(see link:http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/[`linux-input`]
mailing list archives for more info).
If you use kernel 3.14 or later, you might already have the device
supported fine.

Meanwhile, you might want to take a look at

Fingerprint reader
------------------

I haven't focused on that yet, but
link:http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/[`fprint`]
project should be the answer.
